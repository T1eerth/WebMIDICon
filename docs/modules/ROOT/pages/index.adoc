= WebMIDICon

A collection of *hackable web-based MIDI instruments*, implemented as a web-based MIDI controller.

I wanted to create a MIDI instrument that allows me to jam with other musicians. Play MIDI with your PC keyboard, or with a touch screen on an iPad.

== Features

WebMIDICon works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. It lets you use one tool for many use cases.

On the desktop, you can xref:midi-keybindings.adoc[play MIDI notes with your keyboard], and optionally xref:pedal.adoc#joypedal[plug in a game controller to use as a sustain pedal].

On tablets and mobile devices, you can play MIDI notes and drum notes with your finger. You can put your device on the floor and xref:pedal.adoc#ipedal[use its touch screen as a sustain pedal].
