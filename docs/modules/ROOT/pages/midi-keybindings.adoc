:experimental:

When WebMIDICon is focused, you can use these keys to play MIDI notes with your QWERTY keyboard:

== Transpose

The keys marked as green are used for setting the transpose option. This lets you quickly change keys.

== Access higher notes

If you hold down the kbd:[Alt] key, the notes on the upper row will be shifted up an octave, giving you access to a higher range.

[#sustain]
== Sustain pedal

You can hold down the kbd:[Space] key to activate xref:pedal.adoc[the sustain pedal].
