= RTP-MIDI

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTP-MIDI[*RTP-MIDI*] protocol lets device exchange MIDI data over the network, such as Wi-Fi or LAN.

To minimize the latency, I recommend connecting devices using a LAN cable if possible. Using an ad-hoc Wi-Fi network can also give lower latency than having 2 devices communicate via a Wi-Fi router.
