= IAC

An *IAC (Inter-App Communication) device* is a virtual MIDI device that allows multiple MIDI applications on the same device to communicate with each other.

[#macOS]
== macOS

macOS comes with a built-in *IAC Driver* to facilitate MIDI connections
between applications. See
https://support.apple.com/guide/audio-midi-setup/transfer-midi-information-between-apps-ams1013/mac[*“Transfer
MIDI information between apps in Audio MIDI Setup on Mac”* on Apple
Support] for more information.

[#Windows]
== Windows

You can install https://www.nerds.de/en/loopbe1.html[LoopBe1], a virtual
MIDI device driver for Windows which is free for non-commercial use. If
you need more than 1 port, you can buy the
https://www.nerds.de/en/loopbe30.html[LoopBe30] device.

Connecting *WebMIDICon* through *LoopBe1* to *FL Studio* running on the

[#iOS]
== iOS

You can buy https://www.midiflow.com/[Midiflow] which lets you create
virtual MIDI devices that other apps can use. Please note that iOS is
not that great at multitasking, and from my experience, the application
in the background is automatically killed by the OS after a while.
