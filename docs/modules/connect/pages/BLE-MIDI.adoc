= BLE-MIDI

When it comes to *BLE-MIDI (MIDI over Bluetooth Low Energy)* there are 2
main roles:

* The *Central* (who discovers and connects to Peripherals); and
* The *Peripheral* (who advertises MIDI services so Centrals can connect
to it).

[#macOS]
== macOS

A macOS device can act as both the *Central* and the *Peripheral* at the
same time. You set this up in the *Audio MIDI Setup* app.
Once the Bluetooth connection is establised, the Bluetooth device
becomes available to every macOS app.

See
https://support.apple.com/guide/audio-midi-setup/set-up-bluetooth-midi-devices-ams33f013765/mac[*“Set
up Bluetooth MIDI devices in Audio MIDI Setup on Mac”* on Apple Support]
for more information.

[#Android]
== Android

You can use the
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobileer.example.midibtlepairing[*MIDI
BLE Connect*] app to become a Central establish a MIDI connection to
other peripherals. Other apps can then use this connection to send and
receive MIDI data.

[#iOS]
== iOS

An iOS device can act as both the *Central* and the *Peripheral* at the
same time, but it varies from application to application.

* *GarageBand* can act as the Central.
** To set up: Settings → Advanced → Bluetooth MIDI Devices.
* *Web MIDI Browser* can act as both the Central and the Peripheral.
** To set up: Settings → Bluetooth MIDI → Setup Bluetooth MIDI
Central/Peripheral
* *Midiflow* can act as both the Central and the Peripheral.
** To set up: Config → Bluetooth → “Advertise this device” or “Find
nearby devices”

[#Windows]
== Windows

There is an application called
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/midiberry/9n39720h2m05?activetab=pivot:overviewtab[MIDIberry]
that makes your device act as a *Central*. At least Windows 10 is
required.

WARNING: From my testing, only Bluetooth Input is supported; I could not get
Output to work. Also the app may crash from time to time.

. Go to *Bluetooth and other devices settings*.
. Click *Add device* and then make sure your device is discoverable.
. Select *Bluetooth* and then pair your devices together.
. Open *MIDIberry*.
. Select the Bluetooth *Input*.
. Select the output MIDI device to send the input to. If you want to
send it to another Windows application, use an link:./IAC.md[IAC
device].

[#device]
== MIDI devices

Some devices have built-in BLE-MIDI support, such as the KORG’s
https://www.korg.com/us/products/computergear/microkey2_air/[microKEY
Air].

For other devices, you can buy adapters such as Yamaha’s
https://jp.yamaha.com/products/music_production/accessories/md-bt01/index.html[MD-BT01]
(for devices with MIDI ports) or
https://jp.yamaha.com/products/musical_instruments/pianos/accessories/interfaces/ud-bt01/index.html[UD-BT01]
(for devices with a USB port).
